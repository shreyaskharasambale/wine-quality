Wine is a complicated and interesting topic that has piqued the interest of both amateurs and experts for generations. 
It is not surprising that wine has become a common topic of investigation given the emergence of data-driven ways to 
understand the world. This dataset is related to the popular Portuguese wine “Vinho Verde”. The data describes the 
number of different compounds found in the wine and how they affect its quality. 
The importance of wine quality analysis: 
Ensuring Consistency: Wine producers may make sure that their products satisfy a consistent standard of quality by 
using wine quality analysis. Winemakers can modify their production process to guarantee that each batch of wine is 
of the same quality as the last by analysing important factors including alcohol content, acidity, and sugar levels. 
Regulatory Compliance: Analysing the quality of the wine is crucial for assuring compliance with regulatory criteria, 
which differ from nation to nation. Winemakers can make sure that their goods comply with legal criteria for safety 
and labelling by examining the chemical composition of their wine. 
Overall, wine quality analysis is a crucial tool for the wine business to ensure consistency, improve quality, satisfy 
consumer demand, and maintain legal compliance. 
The research question we have chosen for this coursework is to analyse the quality of wine which is dependent on the 
number of compounds present in the wine. “What relationship exists between the chemical composition of wine—
 including its density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, fixed acidity, volatile 
acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, and chlorides—and how wine experts or consumers can perceive its quality?”
